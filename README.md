<h1 align="center">Roadmap</h1> 

**Thrush Programming Language** tries to be a high-level language but with the characteristic of being memory safe and with a concise and easy to understand syntax. Follow Rust's method of hosting as much as possible on the Stack instead of the Heap. Only in certain areas where it is necessary to use the heap will you have to use the heap. This creates a memory leak-free and fast program. Thrush also tends to form all functions intrinsically and directly in the IR rather than making abstractions in the language itself, which provides concise language development at the last frontier that the compiler touches.
